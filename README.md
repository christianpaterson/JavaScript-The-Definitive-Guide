<h2>In Command-Line-Practice . . .</h2>

I will download a <em>GitHub project</em> to my local machine.

The steps are:
<ol>
    <li>git clone</li>
    <li>git status</li>
    <li>Edit .gitignore if needed</li>
    <li>git remote -v (to check)</li>
    <li>git add .</li>
    <li>git commit - ''</li>
    <li>git push</li>
</ol>

<h4>By the way . . .</h4>

I am thinking of renaming this file 'JavaScript: The Definitive Guide' Notes. I'm reading the book and will decide this week if I shall make a GitHub repo for my notes or not.

I will gradually transform this document into a repo describing what I have learned from "The Definitive Guide." I am interested to learn how I might do this. For example, how do I even rename a GitHub repository?

This README.md is edited from VSCode, and never via GitHub.

Snapshots are always pushed from the command line.

The first letter of commit messages should be capitalized.

Most commonly used JavaScript operators have Left to Right Associativity (the order in whch multiple operations of the same precedence are performed). However, the ternary operator, assignment, exponentiating, and unary operators have Right to Left Associativity.
