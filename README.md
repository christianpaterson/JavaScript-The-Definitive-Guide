<h2>In Command-Line-Practice . . .</h2>

I will download a <em>GitHub project</em> to my local machine.

The steps are:
<ol>
    <li>git clone</li>
    <li>git status</li>
    <li>Edit .gitignore if needed</li>
    <li>git remote -v (to check)</li>
    <li>git add .</li>
    <li>git commit - ''</li>
    <li>git push</li>
</ol>
